Detab keeps your tab bar clean by eliminating duplicate tabs. You can
click the icon to remove duplicated tabs but that shouldn’t be
necessary as it will work in the background—whenever you open a new
tab, if the URL of the new tab (after removing any #fragment) is the
same as an already existing tab, it will close the new tab and make
the existing tab active.

To install:

 - Open chrome://extensions/ in Chrome.

 - Tick the Developer mode check box.

 - Click “Load unpacked extension …” button and select the “detab” directory containing this code.
